I am currently working on this project for FreeCodeCamp, where I am creating a landing page. This project involves designing and coding a visually appealing and functional webpage that showcases the features and benefits of a product. Through this task, I aim to enhance my HTML, CSS, and web design skills, following the guidelines and requirements set by FreeCodeCamp.
